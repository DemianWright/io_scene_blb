# Blender BLB Exporter #
[![License: GPL v2](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v2-blue.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v2-blue.svg)

A [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) add-on written in Python 3 for exporting [Blockland](http://blockland.us/) bricks (.<abbr title="Blockland brick">BLB</abbr> files) directly from Blender 2.67 and newer without the need for intermediary formats or external programs.
It works on the principle of "what you see is what you get", the brick will look exactly the same in-game as it does in the 3D viewport<sup>[__*__](#exporter-fn-1)</sup>.

The add-on does not support importing .BLB files yet.

## Features ##
The exporter supports all BLB features.
- [x] Brick size
   - Automatic calculation or manually defined
- [x] Brick grid
   - Automatic calculation (full brick only) or manually defined
- [x] Coverage
   - Manually define hiding own and adjacent brick quads
   - Automatic area calculation for arbitrary brick grid shapes
   - Automatic and/or manual quad sorting
- [x] Collision boxes
   - Automatic calculation (full brick only) or manually defined
- [x] Textures
   - Automatic (side texture only) or manual brick texture definition
- [x] Quads
   - Triangles are automatically converted to quads
   - N-gons are ignored
- [x] UV coordinates
   - Manually define UV coordinates
   - Automatic UV calculation for all brick textures
- [x] Colors
   - Multiple ways to define colors: materials, object names, vertex paint
   - Per-vertex coloring
   - Transparency
   - Additive and subtractive colors
- [x] Flat and smooth shading
- [x] Save and load export settings
- [x] Export multiple bricks from the same file
- [x] Vertices are all relative to the defined or calculated brick bounds
   - Object centers (orange dot) are irrelevant: calculations are performed using vertex world coordinates
   - Object locations relative to the origin of the world are irrelevant: the calculated center of the brick bounds acts as the new world origin
   - Object locations relative to the Blender grid are irrelevant: the brick bounds define the brick grid origin (however it is highly recommended to align the brick bounds object with the Blender grid for ease of use)
   - This allows you to easily create multiple bricks in the same file in any location in the 3D space and the bricks still export correctly as expected
   - Arbitrary brick grid rotation, however, is not supported
- [x] Selective object export: selection, visible layers, entire scene
- [x] Change brick rotation during export: does not affect objects in the .BLEND file
- [x] Change brick scale during export: does not affect objects in the .BLEND file
- [x] Apply modifiers (e.g. edge split) during export: does not affect objects in the .BLEND file
- [x] Terse file writing: exclude optional lines from the BLB file
- [x] Pretty .BLB files: extraneous zeros are not written at the end of floating point values and if possible, they are written as integers
- [x] Logging with descriptive error and warning messages to help you correct problems with the brick
- [x] Customizable floating point accuracy
- [ ] Exporting DTS collision is not yet supported.

## Brick Scale ##
This add-on defines a `1x1x1` Blockland brick to be exactly `1.0 1.0 1.2` Blender units on the X, Y, and Z axes.
Likewise a `1x1f` Blockland plate is defined to be exactly `1.0 1.0 0.4` Blender units.
However, the final scale of the exported brick can be changed with the [Scale](#scale) property.
For example setting the [Scale](#scale) property to `150%` means that during the exporting process, the [objects](#def-object) are scaled by `1.5`.
This is particularly useful when exporting 3D models created for another BLB exporter/converter that has defined the size of a `1x1f` plate to be different from this exporter.

## Definition Tokens ##
[Definition tokens](#def-definition-token) are special [strings](#def-string) added to the names of [objects](#def-object), materials, vertex color layers, and other Blender data objects that have a name.
A name field may contain other text in addition to definition tokens as long as the tokens themselves are separated from other tokens and text by one [whitespace character](#def-whitespace) such as a space.
The definition tokens may be changed from the defaults by selecting [Custom Definition Tokens](#custom-definition-tokens) in the export dialog.

:bulb: Blender adds a running index (e.g. `.003`) to the end of duplicate object, material, etc. names.
This is handled correctly, you need not worry about it.
The logic for removing the index simply checks if `.` is the fourth last character in the name and simply removes it an everything after it.

:exclamation: Each definition token may only appear once in a name field.

Below is a full list of all default definition tokens with a brief description.
For more information on what each of them do, see the specific section of the readme that relates to that token.
Note that not all definition tokens change the object into a [definition object](#definition-objects).

Default Token | Category | Usable In | Is a [Definition Object](#def-definition-object) | Meaning
--------------|----------|-----------|:----------------------:|--------
`bounds` | [Definition objects](#definition-objects) | [Object](#def-object) name | Yes | This is a bounds definition object.
`collision` | [Definition objects](#definition-objects) | [Object](#def-object) name | Yes | This is a collision definition object.

`qs` | [Quad sorting](#defining-quad-sections--coverage) | [Object](#def-object) name | No | Sort these [faces](#def-face) in the south section.
`qw` | [Quad sorting](#defining-quad-sections--coverage) | [Object](#def-object) name | No | Sort these [faces](#def-face) in the west section.

`blank` | [Colors](#defining-colors) | Material name | No | Do not write a color for [faces](#def-face) using this material: use the in-game spray can color as is.
`cadd` | [Colors](#defining-colors) | Material name, vertex color layer name | No | Add the material/vertex color of these [faces](#def-face) to the in-game spray can color.
`csub` | [Colors](#defining-colors) | Material name, vertex color layer name | No | Subtract the material/vertex color of these [faces](#def-face) from the in-game spray can color.

### Mesh Definition Tokens ###
Mesh definition tokens are a sub-category of [definition tokens](#definition-tokens) that can only be used in the names of [objects](#def-objects) but do not change the object into an invisible [definition object](#definition-objects).
Objects that have one or more of these definition tokens are treated as [visible objects](#def-visible-object) and they govern some aspect of the [faces](#def-face) of the [mesh](#def-mesh) in that object.

:exclamation: Each definition token may only appear once in a name field but a name may contain both definition tokens.

Definition | Default Token | Requirements | Maximum Count/Brick | Description 
-----------|---------------|--------------|--------------------:|------------
<a name="mesh-definition-tokens-color">Color</a> | `c` <red> <green> <blue> <alpha> | See [Defining Colors](#defining-colors) | Unlimited | Defines the color of the [faces](#def-face).
Coverage | See [Defining Quad Sorting & Coverage](#defining-quad-sections--coverage) | Must contain a [face](#def-face) | Unlimited |  Assigns the object's quads into a specific section in the brick.

#### Defining Quad Sections & Coverage ####
BLB files allow [mesh](#def-mesh) [faces](#def-face) to be sorted into seven sections: top, bottom, north, east, south, west, and omni.
Quads in these sections may then be automatically hidden in-game using the [coverage system](#def-coverage), if it is defined in a meaningful way in the BLB file.

The coverage system allows the game to skip rendering quads that are completely covered by adjacent bricks improving the frame rate when a large number of bricks are on the screen at once.
Quads are sorted into these sections by using one of the tokens below in the name of the [object](#def-object) containing the faces to be sorted into that section.
If a [visible object](#def-visible-object) has no quad sorting token specified, the omni section is used.

Default Token | Section
--------------|--------
`qt` | Top
`qb` | Bottom
`qn` | North
`qe` | East
`qs` | South
`qw` | West
`qo` | Omni ("any" or "none", **default**)

:exclamation: Sorting quads in this manner is pointless unless the [Coverage](#coverage) property in the export dialog is enabled and at least one option is enabled.

:exclamation: Due to how Blockland handles .blb files, ensure that north is assigned to faces facing the +Y direction, east is assigned to faces facing the +X direction, with south and west corresponding to -Y and -X respectively.

In the export dialog [Coverage](#coverage) properties there are two options for each section/side of the brick:

Option | Description
-------|------------
Hide Self | For example when enabled for the top section, the game will not render the [quads](#def-quad) in the **top** section of **this brick** when the top area of this brick is completely covered.
Hide Adjacent | For example when enabled for the top section, the game will not render the [quads](#def-quad) in the **bottom** section of **adjacent bricks** on top of this brick if the coverage rules for those adjacent bricks are fulfilled.

#### Defining Colors ####
The exporter supports three methods for defining brick colors.
To allow faces to be colored using the spray can tool in game do not assign a color those faces.
See [RGBA Color Format](#rgba-color-format) for a detailed explanation of how to write an RGBA color value.

Method | Overrides | Extent of Coloring | RGB Values | Alpha Value | Notes
-------|-----------|--------------------|------------|-------------|------
Object Colors | In-game paint color | Entire object (color & alpha)| In [object](#def-object) name after the [Color token](#mesh-definition-tokens-color) | In object name after the red, green, and blue values | Implemented only to support legacy brick [models](#def-model), **not recommended for use**.
Material Colors | Object Colors | Assigned faces (color & alpha) | In `Material` tab as `Diffuse Color` | In `Material` tab under `Transparency` in `Alpha` slider| The **recommended method** for defining color. Multiple materials may be used in a single object.
<a name="vertex-colors">Vertex Colors</a> | Material Colors | Entire [object](#def-object) (per-vertex color), entire object (alpha) | In `Data` tab under `Vertex Color` as a vertex color layer, modified using the `Vertex Paint` mode | In `Data` tab under `Vertex Color` as the name of the vertex color layer | Creating a vertex color layers will color the entire object white, but the color of individual vertices may be changed.

There are three definition tokens that are specific to dealing with colors.

Token | Usable In | Description
------|-----------|------------
<a name="defining-colors-blank">`blank`</a> | Material name | Ignore the material's color and do not write any color for the faces with this material assigned so they can be colored by the spray can in-game. This feature exists because an [object](#def-object) that has a material, cannot have faces that do not have a material assigned to them.
<a name="defining-colors-cadd">`cadd`</a> | Material name, vertex color layer name | Use this color as an additive color: add the values of this color to the spray can color in-game. For example to make the spray can color **a little lighter** use a **dark gray** color.
<a name="defining-colors-csub">`csub`</a> | Material name, vertex color layer name | Use this color as a subtractive color: subtract the values of this color from the spray can color in-game. For example to make the spray can color **a lot darker** use a **light gray** color.

##### RGBA Color Format #####
The exporter understands two ways of defining an RGBA color using text.

:exclamation: Please note that you **must** use a comma character (`,`) as the decimal separator for floating point numbers.

1. The commonly used method of writing 4 integers that are in the range 0–255, where 0 is black, separated with a whitespace character such as a space.
For example `127 255 10 191` for a yellow-green color that is 25% transparent.
A full [object](#def-object) name could be for example `glass c 240 255 255 128.001`.
   - In the above example the running index `.001` that Blender added at the end would be removed by the exporter.
1. Writing 4 decimals in the range 0.0–1.0, where 0.0 is black, separated with a whitespace character such as a space.
An [object](#def-object) could have a name such as `c 0,125 0,0 0,5 1,0 flower`, for example.
   - The leading zero may be omitted.
   - Up to 16 decimals are supported.

## Definition Objects ##
When a specific definition token is read in an [object's](#def-object) name it is treated as a definition object.
Definition objects contain non-visual data about the [brick](#def-brick) and as such are not exported as [visual objects](#def-visual-object)

Definition Object | Default Token | Requirements | Maximum Count/Brick | Must Be Within [**Bounds**](#definition-objects-bounds)  | Axis-Aligned | Brick Grid Aligned | Can Overlap | Description
------------------|---------------|--------------|--------------------:|:-------------------:|:------------:|:------------------:|:-----------:|------------
<a name="definition-objects-bounds">Bounds</a> | `bounds` | At least two vertices, must have volume | 1 | N/A | Yes [**(1)**](#definition-objects-fn-1) | Yes | N/A | Defines the dimensions or the size of the brick.
<a name="definition-objects-collision">Collision</a> | `collision` | At least two vertices, must have volume | 10 | Yes [**(2)**](#definition-objects-fn-2) | Yes | No | Yes | Defines a collision [cuboid](#def-cuboid). See [Defining Collision](#defining-collision) for more info.
Brick Grid | See [Defining Brick Grid](#defining-brick-grid) | At least two vertices, must have volume | Unlimited | Yes | Yes [**(1)**](#definition-objects-fn-1) | Yes | Yes [**(3)**](#definition-objects-fn-4) | Defines a volume in the brick grid to fill with a specific brick grid symbol.

<a name="definition-objects-fn-1">**(1)**</a> It is highly recommended to use [axis-aligned cuboids](#def-aac) to define bounds and the [brick grid](#def-brick-grid).
However, if you insist on defining the size of your brick in monkey heads, you can.
Only the [axis-aligned bounding box](#def-aabb) of the bounds and brick grid objects are used.

<a name="definition-objects-fn-2">**(2)**</a> Collision boxes outside brick bounds are technically not invalid and the brick will function in-game.
This behavior is not allowed by the exporter because collision outside brick bounds is horribly broken as it was never intended work in that manner.

<a name="definition-objects-fn-3">**(3)**</a> See [Defining Brick Grid](#defining-brick-grid) for the specific rules about overlapping brick grid definitions.

### Defining Collision ###
Blockland bricks only supports [AABB collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_box#Axis-aligned_minimum_bounding_box).
In other words brick collision may only be defined using [cuboids](#def-cuboid) of varying sizes that align with the coordinate axes.
You can rotate said cuboids however you want but that will not lead to rotated collision cuboids in-game.
Only the the [axis-aligned bounding box](#def-aabb) of the collision definition objects are used.

:bulb: Using any other shape than an axis-aligned cuboid to define collision is not recommended as it makes the Blender file more difficult to understand and also breaks the "what you see is what you get" principle.

### Defining Brick Grid ###
Brick grid definitions represent a 3D volume in the 3D space the brick grid encompasses.
You can imagine it as if the entire cuboidal shape of the brick would be filled with 1x1f plates and these volumes define the properties of all the 1x1f plates within that volume.
Each brick grid definition has their own priority.
When two or more brick grid definition objects overlap in 3D space, the one with the **higher** priority takes precedence and will overwrite the symbols in the brick grid that any definitions with lower priorities would have written.

:exclamation: Be aware that if your brick does not contain a `brickd` definition on the bottom of the brick, the brick cannot be planted on other bricks or the ground.

Default Token | Brick Grid Symbol | Description
--------------|:-----------------:|------------
`gridb` | `b` | Bricks may be placed above and below this volume. This brick can be planted on the ground.
`gridd` | `d` | Bricks may be placed below this volume. This brick can be planted on the ground.
`gridu` | `u` | Bricks may be placed above this volume.
`grid-` | `-` | Bricks may be placed inside this volume. (I.e. empty space.) This is the default symbol, any volume that does not have a brick grid definition uses this symbol.
`gridx` | `x` | Bricks may not be placed inside this volume.

## Brick Textures ##
Defining brick textures is done using Blender materials.
To assign a brick texture to a face, assign a material to it containing a valid brick texture name (case insensitive):
- `bottomedge`
- `bottomloop`
- `print`
- `ramp`
- `side`
- `top`

If no brick texture is defined, `side` is used.
Material name may contain other words as long as the brick texture name is separated from them with one whitespace character such as a space.
A common combination is to define a brick texture name and the [definition token `blank`](#defining-colors-blank) (e.g. `blank ramp` or `side blank`) to allow the player to color the face in-game using the spray can.

## UV Mapping ##
Manually defined UV coordinates must be stored in one or more UV layers that do not share a name with one of the automatically generated UV layers:
- `TEX:BOTTOMEDGE`
- `TEX:BOTTOMLOOP`
- `TEX:PRINT`
- `TEX:RAMP`
- `TEX:TOP`

Any data in UV layers with one the names above will the overwritten during automatic UV calculation.

:exclamation: Note that BLB files only support storing quads.
As such, any tris with UV coordinates will have their last UV coordinate duplicated to transform it into a quad.
This may or may not cause visual distortion in the UV mapping.

If the [Calculate UVs](#calculate-uvs) property is enabled, UV coordinates will be automatically calculated based on the dimensions of the quad and the name of the material assigned to it.
(See [Brick Textures](#brick-textures) to learn how to define brick textures with materials.)
The generated coordinates are only guaranteed to be correct for strictly rectangular quads, for any other shapes the results may not be satisfactory.
If using brick textures on non-rectangular quads it is recommended to manually define the UV coordinates for best results.

## Rounded Values ##
Floating point numbers (numbers with a decimal point) contain [inherent inaccuracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems).
For example when exporting a 1x1x1 brick [model](#def-model) at the maximum accuracy the vertex coordinate of one of the corners is `0.5 0.5 1.5000000596046448`.
This causes the 1x1x1 brick to be `3.00000011920928955078125` plates tall instead of exactly `3.0` like it should.
The only way to get fix this error is to round the vertex coordinates.
Practically speaking it is impossible to visually discern the difference between a brick that is 3 plates tall versus one that is `3.00000011920928955078125` plates tall in the game.
The only real benefit that comes from the rounding is nicer looking .BLB files.

The default value of `0.000001` was chosen through manual testing.
Rest assured that the rounding will cause no visual oddities whatsoever because the value is so small.
This was manually confirmed with a sphere brick made from 524288 quads.
Moving the camera as close to the surface of the brick as the game was capable of rendering, the surface of the sphere appeared mathematically perfect because the distance between the vertices was less than the size of a single pixel.

:exclamation: The exporter will only ever write up to 16 decimal places regardless of the precision of the value.

Floating Point Value | Rounded

[Visible object](#def-visible-object) vertex coordinates | Yes
[Bounds object](#definition-objects-bounds) vertex coordinates | Yes
[Collision object](#definition-objects-collision) vertex coordinates | Yes
[Brick grid object](#defining-brick-grid) vertex coordinates | Yes
Normal vectors | [Optional](#round-normals)

AABB | Calculate the [axis-aligned bounding box](#def-aabb) of all [visible objects](#def-visible-object) and use that as the collision cuboid.

#### Calculate Coverage ####
Enable coverage calculations.
This is pointless unless [Automatic Quad Sorting](#automatic-quad-sorting) is enabled or at least one [object](#def-object) has a quad sorting definition.

Automatically calculate the correct section for quads that in the same plane as the bounding planes of the bounds object.
This is pointless unless [Coverage](#coverage) is enabled.
(Default: `True`)

#### Use Material Colors ####
Assign [face](#def-face) colors from [object](#def-object) materials.
(Default: `False`)

#### Use Vertex Colors ####
Assign [face](#def-face)  colors from vertex color layers.
(Default: `False`)

#### Parse Object Colors ####
Assign [face](#def-face) colors from [object](#def-object) names.
(Default: `False`)

#### Calculate UVs ####
Automatically calculate correct UV coordinates based on the brick texture name specified in the material name.
See [UV Mapping](#uv-mapping) for more information.
(Default: `True`)

#### Square Side UVs ####
Instead of attempting to calculate the appropriate UV coordinates for a face with the SIDE texture, use a square that takes up the full UV space instead.
The UVs will be identical to that of the PRINT texture.
Sometimes when the automatic side UV calculation fails miserably this option may produce a better result.
(Default: `False`)

#### Store UVs ####

See [Rounded Values](#rounded-values) for more details.
(Default: `0.000001`)

### File Properties ###

#### Pretty Print ####
When enabled does not write extraneous zeros to the end of floating point numbers.
Additionally if a numerical value is exactly equal to an integer, no decimal places are written.
If disabled will write all floating point numbers using as many decimal places as used in the [Precision](#precision) property. 
(Default: `True`)

#### Write Log ####
Write a log file to the same folder as the exported brick detailing the export process.
Shows additional settings when selected.
(Default: `True`)

#### Only on Warnings ####
Write a log file only if warnings or errors occurred during the export process.
(Default: `True`)

#### Terse Mode ####
When enabled does not write optional lines to the .BLB file such as the lines marking the different quad sections.
Using this option is not recommended as it makes the .BLB file harder to read and understand.
Although the file is shorter, the difference in file size is negligible.
(Default: `False`)

## Troubleshooting ##
Solutions to common issues with the BLB Exporter.
If you have another issue with the exporter be sure to enable the [Write Log](#write-log) property and export again.
The log file may contain warnings or errors describing issues with the [objects](#def-object) and how to fix them.
Additional instructions on how to fix specific issues are detailed in the [Warning & Error Log Messages](#warning--error-log-messages) section.

### Automatically calculated UV coordinates for brick textures are distorted ###
The automatic UV calculation is only designed to work with rectangular quads.
Manually define UV coordinates for non-rectangular quads.

### Automatically calculated UV coordinates for brick textures are rotated incorrectly ###
The quad with incorrectly rotated UV coordinates (e.g. the lightest side of the SIDE texture pointing sideways instead of up) is not a perfect rectangle.
Even one vertex being off by some minuscule, visually indistinguishable amount from a perfectly rectangular shape can cause the automatic UV calculation to incorrectly determine the rotation of the quad.
Double check all 4 coordinates of the quad and manually correct any floating point errors.
If working on axis-aligned quads or if the vertices should be on grid points snapping the coordinates of the problem quad to grid coordinates by selecting `Mesh > Snap > Snap Selection to Grid` in the 3D viewport toolbar usually fixes floating point errors.

### The TOP brick texture has incorrect rotation in Blender ###
Blockland automatically performs rotations on the UV coordinates of the TOP brick texture during runtime so that the lightest side of the texture is always facing towards the sun.
Because of this there is no correct way of representing the TOP brick texture in Blender.
As a compromise the exporter will rotate the lightest side of the TOP brick texture to face towards the axis select in the [Forward Axis](#forward-axis) property.
This means the UV coordinates of the TOP brick texture in Blender may not match those in the written BLB file.

## Warning & Error Log Messages ##
Detailed explanations of the warning and error messages logged by the program and directions on how to solve the associated issues.
In the messages listed in this section the `#` character is used to represent a variable numerical value.
Text in `code tags` describes a variable alphanumeric value, commonly the name of a Blender object.

### Warnings ###
Warning log messages can be ignored as the issues are automatically corrected, but the resulting brick may not behave or look as excepted.
It is recommended to manually adjust the brick until no warning messages are present in the output log.

### Errors ###
Errors are separated into two categories: fatal and non-fatal errors.
* Fatal errors cause the program execution to stop as there is insufficient or incorrect input data to process into a Blockland brick.
* Non-fatal errors occur when the exporter attempts to do something (due to invalid input data) that would have caused an error when loading or using the exported brick in game.
Alternatively the user has attempted to do something that is explicitly not allowed by the exporter or would lead to a mathematical error.

It is recommended to manually adjust the brick until no error messages are present in the output log.

#### Fatal Errors ####
Fatal errors always lead to the program execution stopping.
